  I am attending the following conventions in 2014. If you haven't been to one before and you'd like me to guide you through one, email me.

  Feel free to contact me at me@epochwolf.com for rideshare and roomshare information. If you're interested in sharing a room with me, I recommend looking at my example [roomshare agreement](/furry/roomshare/). All ride and room shares are subject to approval.
