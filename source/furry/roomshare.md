title: Roomshare Agreement
layout: page
---

This agreement is meant to set some rules and guidelines so everyone using the room knows what’s expected so we can all have a fun, conflict-free convention and have the opportunity to get decent amount of sleep. Some rules are subject to negotiation. I’m a reasonable person and I’m willing to make adjustments. 

Most of these rules are for my safety, the safety of my belongings, and the safety of my job. I work in the financial industry and my company has high ethical standards. Getting arrested for serving underage people alcohol could get me fired. I also can't afford to get sick. I have limited vacation time and being sick means I won't be able to attend conventions later in the year.

<h1>THE AGREEMENT <small>To be signed in blood and secured by your first born's life.</small></h1>

The room will be in my name. I am fronting the money for the hotel room and taking the majority of the risk. 

You will need to bring a photo id for age verification, pay your share in full with the agreed method of payment, and sign a roomshare agreement before receiving a room key or putting anything in the room.

In the event you don't use the room for a night, unless you have cleared it with me in advance, I don't offer refunds. However, if you need to leave the convention early, for any reason, I will refund you a prorated amount. Depending on the circumstances, I may allow you to leave things behind and have me transport them back to you after the convention. 

# Rules 

These are not up for negotiation.

1. No activities that violate the hotel's policies or US law. This means no drugs, smoking, or underage drinking in the room.
2. Anyone sharing the room must be at least 18 years old. If alcohol is present, you must be 21. I will be checking ids.
3. If I find anyone passed out or throwing up in the room, I am calling an ambulance. 
4. No sex in the room, period. 
5. Clothing is not optional. At a minimum you must wear undergarments unless you’re in the bathroom. 
6. You must shower or bathe at least once every 24 hours. 
7. No charges to the hotel room.
8. No one is allowed to stay the night in the room without payment and a signed roomshare agreement. 
9. No sharing or giving away your hotel key without explicit permission from myself. 
10. Respect other people’s belongings and space. Just because it's in the room doesn't mean you can use it.
