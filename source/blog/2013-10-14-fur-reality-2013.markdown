I just attended my first furry convention: [Fur Reality](http://www.furreality.org/). I found out about it only a week before it started from a random user on Reddit. Since it was a mere 15 minutes from my apartment in Cincinnati, I jumped at the chance even though there were some complications. My grandparents had already planned on staying at my apartment for Friday night on their annual drive to escape Wisconsin winters by going to Florida. I also had to work Friday and I didn't have any available vacation time. So I was going to miss some sessions and have to figure out how to leave work early. 

# Friday

Some things didn't go as well as I had planned. The convention started at 1pm. For some reason I thought it started at 4pm until I realized my mistake on Friday at 2pm. So, I asked my boss if I could leave earlier than I had planned. He was gracious enough to let me make up my hours later. I didn't tell him I was going to a furry convention before my grandparents arrived. In hindsight I wished I had said something instead of leaving him to assume. Honesty is the best policy.

I did get to the convention in time for the "So this is your first Fur Con?" session. The <abbr title="People in animal costumes, see photo.">fursuiters</abbr> terrified me. I'd seen photos of them before but I wasn't prepared to see them walking in real life. The panelist explained some basic rules: don't tackle the fursuiters, don't touch people without permission, and fursuiters don't have any peripheral vision so look out for them. 

I'm really glad I got to the convention early so I could find out right away there are a couple different types of fursuiters. Some of them don't talk so they'll only communicate in gestures or animal noises. Others don't want to be touched. It took me a while to recognize which was which and figure out how to interact with them. 

I stayed around for the next session (Tri-State Meet and Greet) and then hung out in the hotel lobby for half an hour. I ended up talking about Scuba diving and some WWII trivia with one of the other attendees. Then I had to leave to be with my grandparents. 

I missed the writing session much to my disappointment but I also missed the movie night turned drinking game turned mass alcohol poisoning. I don't drink and being the only sober person in a room of drunk <abbr title="Not to be confused with the fursuiters. Most furries did't wear fursuits at this convention.">furries</abbr> would not have been good. 

# Saturday

Saturday was a blast. I got up a little earlier than usual and drank coffee with my grandparents before seeing them off to Florida. Thanks to my experiences on Friday, I packed a backpack with some water, food, and a notepad. I had a light breakfast at home then drove to the hotel and arrived just before 10am. 

<a href="/photos/kai-balancing-bone/"><img src="/blog/2013/10/14/fur-reality-2013/kai-balancing-bone.jpg" height="225" width="300" class="right pad-left" alt="Kai balancing a bone on his nose." title="Kai balancing a bone on his nose."></a>
The first session was "Intro to Fursuiting". I wanted to know more about the people that wore animal costumes so I figured it would be interesting. It was pretty much a crash course in etiquette, role playing, and staying healthy. At the end of the session, there were four fursuiters that decided to goof around. That was pretty entertaining and enlightening for me. After watching them role play with eachother, I finally understood what they were doing and how to interact with them. 

So I invited one of the fursuiters to hug and scritch like had seen them do earlier. In this context, scritching is basically the same motions as petting a dog. Only the dog is petting you. And the dog is actually a guy (or gal) in an animal suit. If you like hugs and physical contact, it's actually really nice. That is unless you're ticklish and the fursuiter has claws on their <abbr title="Furry term: hands = handpaws, feet = footpaws">handpaws</abbr>.

That ended up being kind of funny. Once the dingo accidentally tickled me, he started doing it on purpose, and chased me when I backed away. It turned into a game for a bit. When I finally ask him to stop, he did. Then he patted me on the back to reassure me it was all in fun. I returned the pat and offered him a hug which he accepted.

This is why I enjoyed the convention so much. It's a bunch of adults playing. The barrier for physical contact is extremely low. As adults, this kind of close contact is considered inappropriate unless you're very close friends with the person. This aspect of furry conventions is like a weird version of a cuddle party where half of the people are in animal costumes. 

After the "Intro to Fursuiting" session I had a quick break for lunch and then I came back for "Furries in Mainstream Comics". It was interesting to see the difference in comics from America and those from Europe. In short, I'm disappointed that "funny animals" are limited to kids. I grew up with reading Jack London and Calvin and Hobbes and watching stuff like Disney's Robin Hood. Why can't we have more <abbr title="First person to mention furry porn, dies.">adult-oriented</abbr> funny animals?

When the comics session wrapped up, I headed over to Pandora Con (a science fiction/steampunk convention Fur Reality partnered with) for the Costume Parade. By the time of the parade I was perfectly comfortable with the fursuiters and really enjoyed watching all of them walking around.

<a href="/photos/fur-reality-2013/"><img src="/blog/2013/10/14/fur-reality-2013/me-iiiix-and-jaru.jpg" height="225" width="300" class="left pad-right" alt="Me, IiiiX and Jaru." title="Me, IiiiX and Jaru."></a>
Once the parade wrapped up, I was able to get a photo taken of myself with two fursuiters I had been hanging around with in the morning. I also ended up talking to a teenage boy in a cute and pink mouse costume. He was really excited about Doctor Who which was the Pandora Con theme. I'm going to have to actually watch Doctor Who to make sense of half of the stuff he said. Then I mingled a bit more and took some photos. 
 
Since I had some time to kill before the next Fur Reality session, I headed into the theater where Jason Carter (Played Marcus Cole on Babylon 5) had been talking for an hour and a half to a bored audience. It was painful to watch him completely bomb for the next thirty minutes but I didn't have anything else more interesting to do. 

Finally 4pm rolled around and half of the furry convention and more than a few Pandora Con attendees flooded the theater for "Who's Lion is it Anyway!", a variation on "Whose Line is it Anyway?". It turned out pretty well. The audience played all of the parts and most of the jokes were funny and the ones that weren't were still amusing in how badly they failed. Doctor Who's regeneration as a furry blue dragon was rather hilarious with the companion saying "What the fuck are you!?" and the fursuiter replying with shrug, "I have no idea." It finished with the organizer being quite pleased that the first time he had tried the show both furries and non-furries was one of the funniest he had done. Apparently furries and non-furries don't always do well in mixed company. 

I finished up the night with "<abbr title="Dragon + Ferret">Dragget</abbr> Show Live". The same guy who did "Who's Lion is it Anyway?" does a furry podcast with his boyfriend. I've listened to the first fourteen episodes and wouldn't recommend it to my friends. It's offensive and obscene to large degrees. I find the anti-semetic jokes by the self-proclaimed Jewish-descent Catholic-raised gay ferret to be hilarious. Few, if any, of my friends would laugh with me. 

With a new podcast to listen to, I headed home. This would be a good time to mention: if you go to a convention, remember to eat a decent amount of calories (400+) for lunch. I ate very light for both breakfast and lunch and ended up pretty wiped out. If I had been staying at the hotel and gone to the after session parties, it wouldn't have gone well for me. 

# Sunday

<a href="/photos/fursuit-building/"><img src="/blog/2013/10/14/fur-reality-2013/fursuit-building.jpg" height="225" width="300" class="right pad-left" alt="So you want to build a fursuit?" title="Everyone staring at Punk Cat, who stuck his tail in the door on purpose. "></a>
I jumped back into the convention at noon for "So you want to build a fursuit?". I wasn't all that interested in making a fursuit myself, I was just curious how they were put together. Turns out there is a lot that goes into them that I didn't think about like molding claws and teeth out of clay. One of the fursuiters, appropriately named "Punk Cat", decided to drop in and get his tail stuck in the door on purpose just to cause a scene. Everyone in the picture is staring at him instead of moving to help. 

After that I did a 2 hour game of "Lupus in Tabula", a party game similar to Mafia or Werewolf. It was a lot of fun, in the first round I helped lead the villagers to success in lynching the last werewolf. In the second round, I got eaten half way through and eventually so did the rest of the village.

Then the convention finished up with some closing ceremony by the organizer and some of the sponsors. Fur Reality was founded, funded, and organized in just two months. Attendance reached 150 people, there weren't any major issues with the attendees, and the hotel was thrilled to host the convention. 

My first furry convention was a lot of fun. I'll definitely attend Fur Reality next year if I'm still in Ohio. In the mean time I'm going to look at going to a larger conference early next year.
