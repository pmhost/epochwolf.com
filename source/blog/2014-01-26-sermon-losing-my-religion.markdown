> <sup>9</sup> As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him.
> 
> <sup>10</sup> And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. <sup>11</sup> And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” <sup>12</sup> But when he heard it, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. <sup>13</sup> Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”

> <sup>34</sup> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, 
a friend of tax collectors and sinners. 
 

## Luke 14:16-18; 21-23 

> <sup>16</sup> But he said to him, “A man once gave a great banquet and invited many. <sup>17</sup> And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ 18 But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused.’
>
> <sup>21</sup> So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’ <sup>22</sup> And the servant said, ‘Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’ <sup>23</sup> And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.
