With the death of google reader, I don't follow as many blogs as I used to. The blogs I follow either post to twitter or have emails notification of new posts. 

[Evening Edition](http://evening-edition.com/)
: The important bits of world news each day. 

[ZB's Blog of Awesomeness](http://zbpublications.wordpress.com/)
: The blog of an author that attended the same writing meetup in Seattle as I did. She's an awesome person.

[Marco.org](http://www.marco.org/)
: You may notice a passing similarity stylewise. I did steal Mr. Arment's stylesheet for it's responsive widths. 

[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/)
: If you follow Marco Arment, you probably follow John Gruber. 

# Podcasts
I love podcasts. I grew up listening to local talk radio shows. Podcasts are talk radio for the modern age.  

[Unprofessional](http://www.muleradio.net/unprofessional/) &dagger;
: A podcast with professionals that's completely unprofessional. The title fits. They have technical people on the show but they aren't allowed to talk about technology. 

[The Talk Show](http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/)
: I listen to the show for John Gruber. There are some fun discussions that happen. 

[Just The Tip](http://justthetip.fm/) &dagger;
: Amy Jane Gruber (John Gruber's wife) and Paul Kafasis on a short podcast discussing some of the funny things about life. Definitely not safe for work. My family probably shouldn't know I listen to this.

[Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm)
: Tech Podcast by Marco Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa. I find these three to be fun to listen to. I enjoyed their [car podcast](http://neutral.fm/) even though I know nothing about cars. 

[Let's Make Mistakes](http://www.muleradio.net/mistakes/)
: Design podcast with Mike Monteiro and a female co-host. (He's had 3 different ones so far) Some interesting discussions. I enjoy about half the episodes.
