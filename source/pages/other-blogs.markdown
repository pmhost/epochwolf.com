With the death of google reader, I don't follow as many blogs as I used to. The blogs I follow either post to twitter or have emails notification of new posts. 

[ZB's Blog of Awesomeness](http://zbpublications.wordpress.com/)
: The blog of an author that attended the same writing meetup in Seattle as I did. She's an awesome person.

[Marco.org](http://www.marco.org/)
: You may notice a passing similarity stylewise. I did steal Mr. Arment's stylesheet for it's responsive widths. 

[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/)
: If you follow Marco Arment, you probably follow John Gruber. 

# Podcasts 
I love podcasts. I grew up listening to local talk radio shows. Podcasts are talk radio for the modern age.  

[Size Matters](http://www.sizematterspodcast.com/) &dagger;
: A [furry](/pages/what-is-a-furry/) podcast focusing on furries who are taller than skyscrapers or the size of your computer mouse. It is without a doubt one of the more bizarre things I've listened to. I've met one of the co-hosts, Kenson, in person. It is a fairly tame podcasts as furry podcasts go. 

[All Things Trek](http://www.allthingstrek.com/)
: The title says it all. It's a podcast about star trek. 

[Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm)
: Tech Podcast by Marco Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa. I find these three to be fun to listen to. I enjoyed their [car podcast](http://neutral.fm/) even though I know nothing about cars. 

[Welcome to Night Vale](http://commonplacebooks.com/welcome-to-night-vale/)
: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Night_Vale) explains it best: The podcast consists of "news, announcements and advertisements" from a desert town, located "somewhere in the Southwestern United States". In an interview with NPR, Joseph Fink commented on the creation of the series, stating that he "came up with this idea of a town in that desert where all conspiracy theories were real, and we would just go from there with that understood."

## Older podcasts I still recommend but don't have time to listen to often

[The Incomparable](http://5by5.tv/incomparable)
: A weekly dive into geeky media, including movies, books, TV, comics, and more.

[Unprofessional](http://www.muleradio.net/unprofessional/) &dagger;
: A podcast with professionals that's completely unprofessional. The title fits. They have technical people on the show but they aren't allowed to talk about technology. 

[The Talk Show](http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/)
: I listen to the show for John Gruber. There are some fun discussions that happen. 

[Just The Tip](http://justthetip.fm/) &dagger;
: Amy Jane Gruber (John Gruber's wife) and Paul Kafasis on a short podcast discussing some of the funny things about life. Definitely not safe for work. My family probably shouldn't know I listen to this.
