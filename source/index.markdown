I'm a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer and hobbyist writer in Cincinnati, OH. Formerly in Bothell, WA.

I'm a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy. I'm always reading something in one of those genres. Once in a while, I'll pick up a biography or a text book. The biggest thing I miss from college is the ability to take classes outside of my normal field of study.
